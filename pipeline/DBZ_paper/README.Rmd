#### This is the README file for all the scripts we have in this directory. As of March 20th 2020, we have three types of scripts shown here: 

- clear_cell.Rmd
- endometrioid.Rmd
- high_grade_serous.Rmd

The names of these scripts are cancer types. In each script, given a cancer type, we do analysis between ovarian and endometrial tissue samples. 
We mainly do DE analysis using edgeR and gene enrichment.  


#### Some background on these tumors / ideas for future analyses:   
**1.** pick one cancer type and compare ovary and endometrium for that type  
**2.** compare all ovary and endometrium, regardless of cancer type  
**3.** Origin of cancer: clear cell and endometrioid come from endometrium. High grade serous comes from fallopian tubes. We can group clear cell and endometrioid, then compare them to HGS.  
**4.** Clear cell and endometrioid of ovary both come from endometriosis, it might be interesting to see if there is anything in common between them.  
**5.** Run a separate clustering analysis for all cancer types. Cancers can form distinct clusters, it might be interesting to compare the clusters. 

The files are saved into folders according to the analysis they do. The analyses described above are saved into these folders, respectively: 
**1.** cancer_type  
**2.** tissue_type  
**3.** origin  
**4.** endometriosis  
**5.** clustering  

Not all of the files above exist at the moment, they will be added later on as well. 

#### Troubleshooting - what to do if you having trouble running these scripts
- In the YAML header, make sure you write the small id number first, for example DH10-DH3 won't run, you need to write DH3-DH10. This is how we save data, and this is also true for the other scripts, too.  
- If you move any of the files elsewhere, the script may break since we source many files and data from various locations.  
- The analysis here isn't incorporated into Snakemake since it is a one time analysis with some specifics.
