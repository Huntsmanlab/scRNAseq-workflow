### Diagnostic Plots 
These plots are intended to give an idea about the model and whether it is a good fit to represent the data we are interested in analyzing. 

Plot samples (replicates, in this case clusters) on a two-dimensional scatterplot so that distances on the plot approximate the expression differences between the samples.  
Clusters shown far apart mean they that are different in terms of gene expression. Cluster shown together are more similar in terms of gene expression.  
```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 6}
plotMDS(dgeObject)
```

#### Plot biological coefficient of variation against gene abundance, in log2 counts per million.  
Biological coefficient of variation is the true variation between genes, and it corresponds to the dispersion parameter of the negative binomial model. To learn more about dispersion, variation and how they relate to one another, read more about the negative binomial model and its implementation in scRNA sequencing data.  
Look for these to make sure your the model is a good fit:  
**1.** High dispersion (variance) for low counts is expected. Dispersion is expected to decrease smoothly as the abundance increases.  
**2.** For humans, common dispersion (the red line) should be around 0.3 - 0.4, meaning replicates can differ by 30% or more. If the common dispersion is more,  
YOU SHOULD NOT BE USING THIS SCRIPT. High dispersion values will influence the differential expression analysis.  

**This plot will give you a measure of the variation between the samples. **
```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 7}
# plot biological coefficient of variation against gene abundance, in ln counts per million 
plotBCV(dgeObject)
```

#### Plot the genewise quasi-likelihood dispersion against the gene abundance (in log2 counts per million).
In this script, we squeeze the dispersion values from raw counts towards the trended dispersion. (This just means we transform the data in certain ways to make the model fit.)
The plots gives an idea about how much the data was squeezed. The expected is too see squeezed dispersion values (shown in red) closer to the trended (blue) line
```{r,echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height = 7, fig.width = 7}
# Plot the genewise quasi-likelihood dispersion against the gene abundance (in ln counts per million).
plotQLDisp(fit)
```


#### Plot the differentially expressed genes  
The blue lines indicate 1-fold up or down. The number of genes that are significantly up or down regulated are shown in the table, according to the plot.  
```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height = 10, fig.width = 7}
# plot the differentially expressed genes 
plotMD(qlf, main = paste('differentially expressed genes in', dh_organoid_ids[[2]], 'compared to', dh_organoid_ids[[1]]), ylab = 'log2 fold change')
abline(h=c(-1,1), col="blue")
```


Take a closer look at the genes visualized above: 
```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# a closer look at top genes: 
summary <- summary(decideTests(qlf))

summary %>% 
    knitr::kable(caption = paste('comparing', dh_organoid_ids[[2]], 'to', dh_organoid_ids[[1]])) %>% 
    kable_styling(full_width = F)
```


Now we narrow down the DE genes a little bit to visualize genes with a reasonably large expression changes. This is helpful to list the biologically more meaningful genes.  
We restrict the fold change to 0.5.  
```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height = 10, fig.width = 7}

plotMD(tr, main = paste('differentially expressed genes in', dh_organoid_ids[[2]], 'compared to', dh_organoid_ids[[1]]), ylab = 'log2 fold change')

```

#### Upregulated genes 
Now we take a closer look at the **upregulated** genes. To look for interesting genes, we do the following filtering:  
We don't show genes with log fold change (LogFC) less than 0.5. 
We also eliminate genes with p values more than 0.05.  
We resticted this table to first 50 genes. 
  
To help interpret, we use the follwing ranking system: 
Genes are ranked separately for log fold change (high to low) and p values (low to high). We then add these ranks together to get **summed_ranks.**  
Genes with smaller summed_ranks have high fold changes and low p values.  
```{r include = FALSE}

# here we do some manipulation to show the upregulated genes in a meaningful way 
upregulated_genes_table <- make_upreg_table(qlf)

DT::datatable(upregulated_genes_table, 
  extensions = 'Buttons', 
  options = list(dom = 'Bfrtip', 
                 buttons = list("copy", "excel", "csv", "pdf")))

# save the table to be loaded later 
write.csv(upregulated_genes_table, file = here('..', 'data', 'dge', 'edgeR_up', paste(params$ids)))

```

#### Downregulated genes 
Filtering and ranking systems is the same as upregulated genes, as explained above. Genes with the highest fold changes and lowest p values have lower summed_ranks.
  
```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# here we do some manipulation to show the upregulated genes in a meaningful way 
downregulated_genes_table <- make_downreg_table(qlf)

DT::datatable(downregulated_genes_table, 
  extensions = 'Buttons', 
  options = list(dom = 'Bfrtip', 
                 buttons = list("copy", "excel", "csv", "pdf")))

# save the table to be loaded later 
write.csv(downregulated_genes_table, file = here('..', 'data', 'dge', 'edgeR_down', paste(params$ids)))

```


This table tells us how many genes up or down regulated in the analysis with the given log fold change:  
```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}

summary <- summary(decideTests(tr))

summary %>% 
    knitr::kable(caption = paste('comparing', dh_organoid_ids[[2]], 'to', dh_organoid_ids[[1]])) %>% 
    kable_styling(full_width = F)

```

### Gene enrichment  
#### GO Pathway analysis  
Understanding the table:  
**Ont:**  
Note that GO shows three complementary biological concepts including Biological Process (BP), Molecular Function (MF) and Cellular Component (CC).  
You can find these in the 'Ont' column.  
**N:**  
number of genes in the GO term  
**Up:**  
number of up-regulated differentially expressed genes.  
**Down:**
number of down-regulated differentially expressed genes.
**P.Up**  
p-value for the representation of GO pathway in up-regulated genes  
**P.Down**  
p-value for the representation of GO pathway in down-regulated genes  
The above is also true for the KEGG table below. 

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# here we show the results of the go pathways 
gotable <- topGO(go, sort="up")

# do some cleaning up
DT::datatable(gotable, 
  extensions = 'Buttons', 
  options = list(dom = 'Bfrtip', 
                 buttons = list("copy", "excel", "csv", "pdf")))
  
```

#### KEGG analysis 

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# here we show the results of the KEGG analysis 
keggtable <- topKEGG(keg, sort="up")

# do some cleaning up
DT::datatable(keggtable, 
  extensions = 'Buttons', 
  options = list(dom = 'Bfrtip', 
                 buttons = list("copy", "excel", "csv", "pdf")))

```

```{r include = FALSE}
# now we make a heatmap to visualize the DE genes 
# convert the read counts into log2-counts-per-million (logCPM) values
logCPM <- cpm(dgeObject, prior.count=2, log=TRUE)
rownames(logCPM) <- dgeObject$genes$Symbol 
colnames(logCPM) <- paste(dgeObject$samples$group, 1:2, sep="-")
```

Negative Control
This should return to no / few DE genes. 
```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 7}
